# Corner Grocer


For this project I created a program that could read the data from a file, parse and sort the
information, and count each instance of a given occurance. The problem it was solving was to 
take a large amount of raw data, and sort it into a format that was easier to understand. Something
I think I did well was having a very clean main function. I got it down to only two lines of code. In terms 
of how I could enhance my code, I'm sure there are ways I could sort the data in a more effecient way. It isn't a problem
with the little data we used, but I'm sure it would be really inefficient with any substantial amount of data.

The part of the project I had the most trouble with was counting the repeat words. I don't know why but I was thinking
I could compare the two strings with the '==' operator. Luckily I was far from the only person wondering how to do this and
found a very nice stackoverflow thread to help me figure it out. That and YouTube are pretty much the only sources I use, besides 
the course book of course. The skills that I think will be transferable from this project are wrapping my head around how I planned to
sort the information. These things seem like they are hard to grasp until they click, and once they do they seem so simple. For how I
made this program readable and maintainable, I really tried to find ways where I could create the program using the fewest lines possible.
I know there are way better ways for that, but I did try. I also put every task in a simple function that I hope made it easier to read.
